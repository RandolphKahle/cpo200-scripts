# File: save-instance-as-image
#
# Purpose:
#  Saves an instance provided as argument $1 as an image name provided as argument $2
#
# Pre conditions
#  The instance provided as $1 is running
#  There exists no image with the name provided in $2
#
# Issues:
#  The scope information from the running instance are saved to a YAML file
#  but they are not (yet) automatically reused when reconstituting the instance.

gcloud compute images create $2 --source-disk $1
